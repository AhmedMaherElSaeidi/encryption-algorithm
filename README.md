# Encryption Algorithm using Substitution and Transposition

In this algorithm, we use two encryption techniques to encrypt a message. The first technique is substitution, and the second technique is transposition.

## Substitution Encryption Technique

Substitution is a type of encryption technique where each letter in the original message is replaced with another letter or symbol. The substitution key defines the mapping between the original letters and their replacements. 

For example, we can use a substitution key where 'a' is replaced with 'q', 'b' is replaced with 'w', and so on. Once we have the substitution key, we can apply it to the original message to obtain the substituted message.

## Transposition Encryption Technique

Transposition is a type of encryption technique where the positions of the letters in the original message are changed according to a specific rule. In this algorithm, we apply three different transposition techniques on the output of substitution.

## Encryption Process

To encrypt a message using this algorithm, we follow the following steps:

1. Apply substitution on the original message using the substitution key.
2. Apply each of the three transposition techniques on the output of substitution.
3. Choose one of the encrypted messages as the final encrypted message.

This algorithm provides a relatively secure way to encrypt a message by combining two different encryption techniques. However, like any encryption algorithm, it is still vulnerable to attacks and should not be used for highly sensitive information without proper consideration of its security limitations.
